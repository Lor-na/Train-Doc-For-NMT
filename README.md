# Train-Doc-For-NMT
Docs For training a NMT model and some other works.

We take GNMT as an example. Train a en-de translation model following the guide on tensorflow.nmt and expand it on en-zh translation.

Otherwise, there's a char2char model training record, which we want to improve it by adding adversarial samples.
